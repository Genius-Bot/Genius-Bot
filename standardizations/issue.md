# Issue standardizations

Please follow these rules to the best of your ability when submiting a new issue or pull request.

* Is your issue easy to understand (i.e. is it properly formatted)?
* Is your issue valid (i.e. an actual problem/suggestion)?
* Is your issue unique (i.e. are there no other issues like it)?
* Is your issue only one issue (i.e. could it be split up)?
* Is your issue compliant with the current Genius-Bot code (i.e. would it fit in well)?
