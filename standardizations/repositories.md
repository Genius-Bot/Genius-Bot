# Repository standardizations

Please follow these rules to the best of your ability when creating a new repository.

* Use capitalized camel case for the repository name.
* Use valid sentences for the repository description.
* Create a .github folder with everything necessary to make code and issue submission as easy as possible.
* Do not add any special repository settings (i.e. github pages, github wiki, etc...)
* Be sure to give the 'admin' team 'Admin' permissions and the 'member' team 'Read' permissions.
* Follow standard github naming conventions (i.e. "This is an issue template", "epic label", "A cool new label description", etc...)
* Follow the necessary language, issue, and commit standardizations
